    "In this dataset, you are provided with game analytics for the PBS KIDS Measure Up! app. In this app, children navigate a map and complete various levels, which may be activities, video clips, games, or assessments. Each assessment is designed to test a child's comprehension of a certain set of measurement-related skills. There are five assessments: Bird Measurer, Cart Balancer, Cauldron Filler, Chest Sorter, and Mushroom Sorter.\n",

    "\n",
    "She can also repeat the assessment as many times as she wishes. \n",

    "Hello!\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm a data scientist at PBS KIDS and I'm part of the team that developed and helped collect the competition dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "First off, our team will be submitting solutions but we will not be eligible for the cash prizes. \n",
    "I am not a ML expert so I will be relying mostly on feature engineering and my understanding of the subject matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "On that front, I thought it would be helpful for us to give a more detailed description of the media types that are presented in the PBS KIDS Measure Up! app. **These media types are tagged in the dataset as Clip, Activity, Game, or Assessment.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The app is designed to try to guide the kids through an idealized learning path, \n",
    "which is intended to present players with a pattern of exposure->exploration->practice->demonstration (as in demonstration of knowledge).\n",
    "Each of the worlds in the app may have one or more such sequences of media objects, \n",
    "and sometimes the app does not follow this exact formula. However, kids are not required to follow the path that is laid out for them, \n",
    "and whether the suggested linear progression leads to better learning outcomes than a random path is not yet clear.\n",
    "Perhaps this competition will give us some insights into this question as well!\n",
    "\n",
    "Each content type can be loosely thought of as corresponding to a phase of the learning cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Clips\n",
    "Videos are intended to expose the kid to a topic or a problem solving approach. \n",
    "Videos typically model or explain things. There is no interactive component to videos. \n",
    "Clips can further be classified into:\n",
    "- Interstitials: short transitional videos between worlds or sections of the world, in which the protagonists of the adventure (Del, Dot and Dee) are seen exploring the island. Aside from the introductory video titled 'Welcome To The Lost Lagoon!', these can be identified by the title specifying the world and the relevant section (e.g. 'Crystal Caves - Level 1'). These videos merely hint to the subject matter.\n",
    "- Longer clips (2-3 minutes in length): these videos explain an important subject or approach with the help of familiar characters from the PBS KIDS world. Typically these videos have been excerpted from longer television episodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind in the dataset only the start of the video playback is captured. \n",
    "Therefore there are far fewer events corresponding to clips than there are to games or assessments. \n",
    "That does not mean clips are less popular! Also, lack of interactivity not withstanding, \n",
    "there is good evidence that video contributes significantly to learning outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Activities\n",
    "Activities are open-ended mini-games that allow kids to practice their skills in an environment that mimics real life play patterns to support “messing about”. \n",
    "Activities do not have a defined goal, but they do typically model cause and effect. \n",
    "We sometimes refer to Activities as 'sandboxes' or 'toys'.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Games\n",
    "These are the typical video games most people are familiar with. \n",
    "Games help kids practice their skills with the goal of solving a specific problem. \n",
    "Each challenge may belong to a progressively more challenging round (marked in the data), \n",
    "and multiple rounds may be grouped into levels. Games do not end until the player finishes the game or decides to exit the play session.\n",
    "If a final goal is achieved, there is usually an option to replay the entire game from the start.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Assessments\n",
    "Assessments are interactives that are designed specifically with the goal of measuring a player’s knowledge of the subject matter. \n",
    "Metrics that represent the intrinsic knowledge of the user are typically derived either from first principles rooted in childhood educational psychometry or from a posteriori data observations. One such (simple) metric might be the number of incorrect answers leading to the assessment solution, but many others can be formulated."
