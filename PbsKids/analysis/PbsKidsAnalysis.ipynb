    "In this dataset, you are provided with game analytics for the PBS KIDS Measure Up! app. In this app, children navigate a map and complete various levels, which may be activities, video clips, games, or assessments. Each assessment is designed to test a child's comprehension of a certain set of measurement-related skills. There are five assessments: Bird Measurer, Cart Balancer, Cauldron Filler, Chest Sorter, and Mushroom Sorter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The intent of the competition is to use the gameplay data to forecast how many attempts a child will take to pass a given assessment (an incorrect answer is counted as an attempt).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each application install is represented by an installation_id. This will typically correspond to one child, \n",
    "but you should expect noise from issues such as shared devices. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the training set, you are provided the full history of gameplay data. \n",
    "In the test set, we have truncated the history after the start event of a single assessment, chosen randomly, for which you must predict the number of attempts. \n",
    "Note that the training set contains many installation_ids which never took assessments, whereas every installation_id in the test set made an attempt on at least **one assessment.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The outcomes in this competition are grouped into 4 groups (labeled accuracy_group in the data):\n",
    "3: the assessment was solved on the first attempt\n",
    "2: the assessment was solved on the second attempt\n",
    "1: the assessment was solved after 3 or more attempts\n",
    "0: the assessment was never solved\n",
    "\n",
    "The file train_labels.csv has been provided to show how these groups would be computed on the assessments in the training set. \n",
    "Assessment attempts are captured in event_code 4100 for all assessments except for Bird Measurer, which uses event_code 4110. \n",
    "If the attempt was correct, it contains \"correct\":true.\n",

    "- Randomly generated unique identifier grouping game sessions within a single installed application instance.\n",

    "\n",
    "event_code\n",
    "- Identifier of the event 'class'. Unique per game, but may be duplicated across games. E.g. event code '2000' always identifies the 'Start Game' event for all games. Extracted from event_data.\n",

    "- The section of the application the game or video belongs to. \n",
    "- Helpful to identify the educational curriculum goals of the media. Possible values are: 'NONE' (at the app's start screen), TREETOPCITY' (Length/Height), 'MAGMAPEAK' (Capacity/Displacement), 'CRYSTALCAVES' (Weight).\n",
